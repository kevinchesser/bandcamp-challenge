Looks like you might have to combine all of the files together in the right
order what is in the file order. This was figured out by executing the piece
of ruby code that was in another file. From looking at the first in the order
it seems like it is the beginning of what would describe a .WAV file so I think
if you combine all the files together it might make up a actual audio wav file
